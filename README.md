Q3 is a set of packages for scaffolding REST APIs with portable data schemas, controllers and service helpers. It comprises a core package, along with many optional plugins and utilities. Currently, you must install each package separately; however, a script installer will ship in V2.

Note, V1 is still very much in development. I do not recommend deploying yet in production apps. More updates on the way.

Documentation

We host our documentation with GitBook. It auto-syncs with the master repository under the `schema` folder. Mostly, though, we update it through the web admin.
